        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="normal-text">I began my journey in Electrical Engineering as a bachelor’s student at the University of Tehran in 2017.
            In 2019, two years later, I started programming with a focus on C language and AVR microcontrollers.
             This sparked my interest in electronics, where I saw how combining embedded programming with hardware design could lead to success
              in the industry.
               <br><br>
            During my undergraduate studies, I gained hands-on experience in various laboratories and as a member of the ESFA Group.
            In 2022, I successfully completed my bachelor’s degree with a standout final project in embedded systems, which earned the
            Best Undergraduate Project Award at the University of Tehran.
            <br><br>
            That same year, I secured admission to the University of Tehran’s master’s program by achieving 23rd rank in the nationwide
             entrance exam. My thesis focused on improving the small-signal stability of grid-forming inverters, a critical topic in power
              systems and power electronics. I graduated with a distinguished GPA of 18.21/20 (3.86/4).
              <br><br>
            Throughout my master’s program, I gained significant industry experience, working with various companies and laboratories
             as an embedded engineer and electronics designer. My dedication and expertise led to a promotion as the Head of Digital
              Electronics, Embedded Design and Programming Department at my latest workplace (Samwavetech).
              <br><br>
              My interest lies in hardware product development within R&D teams, spanning from simulation, schematic, and PCB design to
              embedded C programming. I also specialize in developing .NET software for communication between system elements.
              <br><br>

            Over the past five years, I’ve mastered a diverse set of skills, including:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Product development from concept to delivery
                </li>
                <li>
                    Team and human resource management
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enhancing research and development environments and procedures
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hardware design, simulation, prototyping, implementation, and testing

                </li>
                <li>
                    IC specification analysis and driver coding

                </li>
                <li>
                    Writing clean, optimized, and efficient code to reduce production time

            <b style="color: red;">Driving Stepper Motor and Angle Control</b>
            <br><br>
            A control sequence is designed based on the principles of stepper motor operation, 
            allowing the user to input a desired angle through a user interface. The motor is then driven
             to the specified position. A custom hardware system measures the current angle, calculates the
              required steps and direction, and sends the necessary pulses to the motor via an advanced driver built around an STM32F1
               microcontroller.

            <b style="color: red;">Designing An Automatic Current Transformer (CT) Tester Module </b>
            <br><br>
            This product was designed as an optimization module for the main device (KAVOSH-T22, developed by the ESFA Group team).
             TCP/IP Ethernet communication was employed to manage the handshake between devices. The module significantly reduced
              outdoor, labor-intensive tests and overhauls by 80%, automating various test procedures and eliminating the need for
               several wiring changes. This automation was achieved using an internal STM32F4 microcontroller and supporting electronic
                circuits. Notable to mention, current transformers (CTs) require periodic testing, which this module streamlined
                 effectively.

            <b style="color: red;">Integrating A Current Transformer (CT) Burden Box Module </b>
            <br><br>
            This product served as another supplementary module for the tester module and KAVOSH-T22. Since CTs cannot operate
             in an open-circuit condition, their performance is analyzed and evaluated by connecting various loads to their secondary
              side, with the results documented in their datasheets. To support manufacturers during initial compliance testing, this
               device was designed to provide the necessary loads or burdens for the CTs, ensuring accurate performance analysis and
                validation.
